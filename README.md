## DSProxy playground


Experimenting with defi contracts / proxy accounts to try to create an ethereuma ccount with better UX.

- Combine multiple actions into one txn (e.g: approve, trade, settle in USDC, initiate an LP position from ETH -> WBTC & WETH -> supply to uniswap)
- Using a new DSProxy identity as the base for your defi activity
